Great location for beautiful pictures of Paris. The molding and the statues on the building are impressive.\nMoving on to the inside - the building is just as impressive. The ceilings are a work of art itself. The corridors are very spacious and nice to walk through.\nWalls and walls of art, literally every style and time period you can imagine. Statues, gold, plates, rugs, mantles, paintings, Crown Jewels and many more.\nThe only downside of the Louvre is that it is GIANT, so please plan your trip ahead! Otherwise you won't see everything you'd like to see because you will run out of time.\nWe did not see the Mona Lisa, it was too crowded. But I was not sad about that, other works of art were even more impressive than the Mona Lisa.",

My last time here the tower was closed because of the snow. However, and after a lot of patience I managed to get in. Only the first and second floors were available. Still, it’s a spectacular view. The sunset is beautiful here. 🫶",
